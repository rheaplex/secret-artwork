"Secret Artwork" (2018), Ethereum ERC-721 NFT contract and visualization.

Each token stores the hash of a secret property of the artwork it claims to 
embody. The web page visualization of each displays this hash and many other
pieces of information about the token and the smart contract containing it in
many different representations. It will tell you everything about the artwork
apart from the one thing you actually want to know - what the secret it
contains actually is.

Although the smart contract code claims that there will be 12 tokens, only two
were minted - Content and Subject - and no more will be. Of these, at the time
of writing, only "Secret Artwork (Content)" has been exhibited.

The code for this work is licensed under the GNU GPL v3 or later. This gives
you the right to display and maintain it without extra permission from the
artist. This is separate from ownership of the token, which is enforced by
the Ethereum blockchain.
